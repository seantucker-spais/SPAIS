## Abstract

We introduce STEM (Spatiotemporal Embedding Model), a deterministic and interpretable vector encoding system designed to stabilize the stochastic behavior of modern AI with a static, algebra-compatible base. STEM provides a reproducible embedding of space and time—anchoring AI reasoning in infrastructure-aware contexts such as transit planning, environmental risk, and emergency management. Unlike learned embeddings, STEM supports transparent, prompt-readable vector logic and enables vector-native spatial joins when used with ontology and geometry embeddings. We formalize the STEM formula, present GeoMesh as an optional global spatial substrate, and explain its foundational role in the forthcoming MOSES system for modular reasoning (Tucker, 2025b).

## 1. Introduction: Stabilizing the Stochastic with the Static

As AI systems increasingly interface with real-world environments, the ability to reason over space, time, and elevation is becoming essential—especially in infrastructure-critical domains such as transportation, urban planning, and disaster response [Goodchild, 2009; Anselin, 2019]. However, the majority of vector embeddings in today’s AI systems—especially in LLMs and multimodal models—are stochastic, opaque, non-reproducible, and algebraically intractable [Bommasani et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Mai et al., 2022; Bengio et al., 2021].

To address these limitations, we build upon the Statically Implied Models (SIMs) framework [Tucker, 2025a], which defines a class of deterministic, interpretable embedding models. SIMs provide a model-theoretic foundation for transparent, symbolic-compatible vector reasoning. They are especially useful when integrating large-scale knowledge systems with vector databases, retrieval-augmented generation, or LLMs, where static and structured reference logic is required alongside dynamic reasoning [Tucker, 2024].

We propose STEM: a deterministic, algebra-compatible embedding that encodes latitude, longitude, altitude, and time into a fixed-length vector with known structure and reproducibility. STEM is the first canonical implementation of a SIM (Statically Implied Model) [Tucker, 2025a].

STEM encodes geospatial and temporal context into a reproducible vector that:

- Represents spatial and cyclic temporal information algebraically
- Supports deterministic proximity, delta-time, and elevation logic
- Allows Prompt-Readable Vector Logic by exposing vector components to prompts or symbolic reasoning modules

STEM is designed to stabilize stochastic AI systems by introducing a static substrate for space-time reasoning—providing reliable anchors for infrastructure-aware applications.

In the forthcoming MOSES system (Modular Onto-Logic Spatial Embedding System), STEM is not a standalone model but a shared vector component embedded within all geo-based SIMs—including GOE (Geospatial Onto-logical Embeddings) and GPLE (Geospatial Poly-Linear Embeddings). These SIMs embed a `stem_vector` field derived from STEM, enabling co-referencing, vector-native joins, and multi-type model integration in vector databases like Weaviate [Yan et al., 2021; Tucker, 2025b].

## 2. Formula and Implementation

Given:

- Latitude: `lat` (in degrees)
- Longitude: `lon` (in degrees)
- Altitude: `alt` (in meters)
- Time of day: `t` (in seconds since midnight)

We define the STEM vector as:

```
STEM(lat, lon, alt, t) = [
    sin(lat), cos(lat),
    sin(lon), cos(lon),
    alt / h,
    sin(2πt/T), cos(2πt/T)
]
```

Where:

- `h` is the maximum expected terrestrial altitude (default: 9000m)
- `T` is the duration of the daily time cycle (86,400 seconds)
